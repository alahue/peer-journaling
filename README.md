# AI Peer Journaling App

An AI-mediated peer journaling platform built for usability study research. Users write journal entries, share them with peers through an AI mediator that redacts personal information and polishes content, respond to peer entries, and reflect on feedback.

The original design is available at https://www.figma.com/design/mj7ZIx9vwfWfna1kjj7HZQ/AI-Peer-Journaling-App.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** SQLite (via better-sqlite3)
- **AI:** Google Gemini 3 Flash Preview API (mediator + validator + simulated peer response)

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
PORT=3001
```

### 3. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This starts both the Vite frontend dev server and the Express backend concurrently. The frontend proxies `/api/*` requests to the backend.

You can also run them separately:

```bash
npm run dev       # Frontend only (Vite)
npm run server    # Backend only (Express)
```

## Usage

### Admin Setup

1. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser.
2. Log in with the admin password set in `.env`.
3. Create participant accounts by entering 4-digit PINs. Each new user is automatically seeded with a sample journal entry and a sample peer entry for the usability study.
4. Use the admin dashboard to view user history or manage accounts.

### Participant Flow (Usability Study)

1. **Login** — Enter your 4-digit PIN at the home page.
2. **History** — Click on the sample journal entry to read it.
3. **Share** — Select a sharing intention (Support, Accountability, or Perspective), select the sample journal entry, and click "Generate Sharing Preview."
4. **Review AI Output** — The preview dialog shows three sections:
   - **Polished Entry** (editable) — The AI-cleaned version with PII redacted and tone polished.
   - **Explanation of Changes** (read-only) — What the AI changed and why.
   - **Warning** (read-only, conditional) — Shown if the original content was too revealing.
5. **Edit & Approve/Deny** — Edit the polished entry if desired, then approve to send or deny to stop.
6. **Review Peer Entry** — Navigate to the Review tab. Read the sample peer entry and respond using the three-part format: "What I heard," "What I'm wondering," "What I suggest."
7. **Reflection Addendum** — Switch to the Reflection Addendums tab. Review the AI-generated simulated peer response to your shared entry, then write a reflection.

## AI Pipeline

### Mediator Model

The mediator processes journal entries before sharing with peers:

- Flags and removes potentially harmful or abusive language
- Detects and redacts personal identifiers (names, phone numbers, addresses, emails)
- Polishes the entry without changing its meaning
- Tailors the polish based on the selected sharing intention

The mediator returns structured output: a polished entry, an explanation of changes, and an optional warning.

### Validator Model

The validator is a second-pass safety check. It receives only the polished entry (not the explanation or warning) and verifies it is free of harmful language and personal identifiers. If validation fails, issues are surfaced to the user for manual correction.

### Simulated Peer Response

After a user approves sharing, the backend generates a simulated peer response using the AI. This response follows the same three-part format used by human peers and is available when the user reaches the Reflection Addendum tab.

## Data Isolation

Each user's data is keyed by their 4-digit PIN. The backend middleware validates the PIN on every request and scopes all database queries to that user. Users cannot see other users' data. The admin dashboard has a separate authentication system using a password-based token.
